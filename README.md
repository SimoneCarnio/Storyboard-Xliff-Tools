# Storyboard & Xliff Tools
My personal collection of scripts to speed up some tasks in my Xcode development process.

##### *** WARNING: These are small scripts, written in short time, without any coding style and tailor made to my necessities. 



## update_storyboard_base.py

Read trasnslations from a xliff file and update base Localization of a xcode storyboard. 

It's useful when you need to change the base localization language and you don't want to rewrite everything in your storyboard.

**Suggested steps:**

* Export xliff from xcode
* Take the xliff file in the language you want use (or translate it)
* Make a backup of you storyboard
* Change paths in this script and run it
* Replace your storyboard and check it in xcode



## more coming soon...
